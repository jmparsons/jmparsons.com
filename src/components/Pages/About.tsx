            background in art and design with a vast portfolio including sketches, drawings, and 3D
            rendered computer generated images. Along with a talent for the visual, Jon is an
            equally competent and capable developer and programmer. His work includes programming in
            several different languages, optimizing site performance and maintenance, and developing
            new and dynamic tools, which enhance the functionality of a site and a user's browsing
            experience.
